        <p>Hi! I'm Eddie and I use Porkbun to buy a lot of the website domains that I use for various web projects. I tend to find myself using Ctrl+F to find domains of a particular price and was getting so fed up of doing it, along with sifting through Handshake domains I have no care for, that I asked Porkbun over Twitter to add some filters and 'sort by' options to their search &mdash; they never answered. So I did it myself, in the form of a Chrome Extension and here it is for you to use!</p>
