        <h3 class="font-bold text-2xl">Welcome to Porkbun Search Filters!</h3>
        <p>Hi! I'm Eddie and I use Porkbun to buy a lot of the website domains that I use for various web projects. I tend to find myself using Ctrl+F to find domains of a particular price and was getting so fed up of doing it, along with sifting through Handshake domains I have no care for, that I asked Porkbun over Twitter to add some filters and 'sort by' options to their search &mdash; they never answered. So I did it myself, in the form of a Chrome Extension and here it is for you to use!</p>
        <h3 class="font-bold text-2xl mt-2">Please read: Usage Guide</h3>
        <p>To use 'sort by' options, please wait until all domain prices have been loaded onto the search page. Only then, click the extension and change the 'sort by' option. The extension grabs the prices from the page when you click the extension, not automatically; please be patient, then click!</p>
        <p>If the formatting and/or sorting does not work as intended, please make your search again and try applying the sorting option then</p>
        <p>Please send what you want adding to me &mdash; Twitter @EddiesTech, email <a href="mailto:ejac@eddiecoldrick.com" class="text-blue-500 no-underline hover:underline">ejac@eddiecoldrick.com</a></p>
